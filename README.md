# Sentiment-Analysis-with-NLTK-Analyzing-Text-Sentiment-Using-Python

Here's a description of each step:

1. Install and import necessary libraries: This step installs the required NLTK library by running the pip install command and imports the necessary modules, including nltk and SentimentIntensityAnalyzer.
2. Download required NLTK resources: This step downloads the required resources for the Vader Sentiment Analyzer, specifically the vader_lexicon, using the nltk.download() function.
3. Instantiate the SentimentIntensityAnalyzer: This step creates an instance of the SentimentIntensityAnalyzer, which is a pre-trained model for sentiment analysis provided by NLTK.
4. Define a function for sentiment analysis: This step defines the analyze_sentiment() function, which takes a text as input and performs sentiment analysis using the SentimentIntensityAnalyzer. It returns the sentiment as 'Positive', 'Negative', or 'Neutral' based on a compound score threshold.
5. Example usage: This step provides an example text for sentiment analysis. You can replace it with your own text to analyze sentiment.
6. Display the sentiment analysis result: This step prints the sentiment analysis result, which will be 'Positive', 'Negative', or 'Neutral' based on the sentiment of the provided text.
7. By following these steps, you can perform sentiment analysis using the NLTK library in a Jupyter Notebook and display the sentiment analysis result.
